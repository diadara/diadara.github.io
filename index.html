  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>This week, I managed to figure out what was causing the issue with my
previous version of the plugin. As I discussed in my previous blog
post, I changed the code execution model for the plugin. Now the code
for the script is loaded as a lua co-routine and executed. Currently
the plugin will block the thread if you make a blocking call from lua.
This can be fixed by yielding to the event loop.</p>

<p>Two approaches are possible to make the plugin 100% non blocking. One
is to write custom lua modules for making network calls that will
integrate with the plugins event loop. Another possible approach as I
discussed earlier was to wrap the sockets api. Currently, the plugin
is functional although I have to check for memory leaks and other
issues.</p>

<p>I started out the project planning to accomplish a lot more, however I
had a few roadblocks that really slowed down the progress. I had
struggled a lot but I have learned a lot about things like event
loops, networking, the HTTP specification, lua,  coroutines, and a
bunch of other interesting stuff. I want to that Eduardo and Jorge for
all the guidance they have given throughout the program. The plugin
can be improved in a lot of ways and I plan to work on it after the
GSoC, the socket library wrapper is on my list first. This will allow
porting openresty  libraries to monkey thus providing an alternative
to duda for writing web applications with minimum hassle with lua.</p>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>In order to implement a nonblocking way to excecute the lua code for
the plugin I have been reading ngnix&rsquo;s
<a href="HttpLuaModule">http://wiki.nginx.org/HttpLuaModule</a>. The module is
implemented with one LUA VM per worker and each lua call/request is
run with it&rsquo;s own coroutine. This seems to be a better approach than
the one I am currently using as this removes the latency involved in
creating a Lua state per request as coroutines are much more
lightweight compared to lua_state, I am currently rewriting some of
the code to work in this way as it might offer much more flexibility
and performance.</p>

<p>from the
<a href="lua%0Angnix%20module%20wiki">https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module/wiki/Introduction</a></p>

<blockquote><p>Lua-nginx-module integrated Lua into NginX, and providing
high-concurrent &amp; non-blocking request processing ability without
forcing developers explicitly dividing business logics into state
machine. Developers can write their programs in plain-old sequential
ways, and lua-nginx-module will automatically interrupt the program
logic at blockable I/O operations, save the context and delegate these
I/O ops to NginX’s event mechanism. When I/O ops are done,
lua-nginx-module will restore the context and restore the normal
running of the program logic. User program itself will feel everything
as usual as never being interrupted.</p>

<p>Lua-nginx-module uses one-coroutine-per-request
request handling model, i.e. for each incoming request,
lua-nginx-module creates a coroutine to run user code to process the
request, and the coroutine will be destroyed when the request handling
process is done. Every coroutine has its own independent global
environment, which inherits shared read-only common data. So any
global values injected by the user code won’t affect other request’s
processing, and will be freed when request handling is done. You can
imagine that user code is running in a ‘sandbox’, which shares the
same lifecycle with the request itself. By this way, lua-nginx-module
can prevent memory-leak caused by abusing uses of global values in
user code, hence improve robustness.</p></blockquote>

<p>The non blocking behaviour of the module is achieved by using
coroutines with blocking calls that yields to the event loop. This is
done using something called <code>cosockets</code> which makes writing sequential
code that works in non blocking way. In order to implement similar
functionality in monkey, this co sockets api has to rewritten to
integrate with monkeys event loop. Although this would require in
effect writing a socket library for lua that specifically works with
monkey, this will make adding more libraries easier in the future as
well as make it possible to use many of the existing libraries for
openresty to monkey lua without much effort other than that required
for dealing with lua 5.1 vs lua 5.2 issues.</p>

<p>This week I completed a for the api documentation. I have a version of
the plugin that is functional in the testing branch of the repo.
Making the plugin non blocking by using co sockets requires some
effort and I have started writing code for this. I will try to finish
this before the pencils down date.</p>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>I haven&rsquo;t been able to figure out what is causing the looping issue
that had been troubling me from last week. I have created a branch
with the old version of plugin working in blocking mode. The plugin&rsquo;s
current execution model is not efficient as it might block the server
thread and a thread based model is also scalable. Also I am creating a
new lua_state instance per request which could be avoided.</p>

<p>I have identified similar areas for performance improvement and most
important of all will be to use a coroutine based approach for
executing the lua code similar to nginx&rsquo;s lua module.I have started
documenting everything that are working right now.In the coming weeks,
I will complete the documentation and move on to fixing issues that I
have identified.</p>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>I seem to have hit a roadblock as I am facing some issues with
integrating the plugin with monkey. Last week I had a working
implementation for the plugin, however on further testing, I noticed
that the plugin will fail while using some features which make use of
the monkey api as the lua execution happens in a new thread. I have
been trying to figure out ways to circumvent the issues without any
luck as I had limited time due to school work.</p>

<p>A temporary solution was to execute the lua code in the plugin context
itself, blocking the thread. I also found a few more issues with the
current implementation which  I am having a little  trouble in fixing.</p>

<p>My project is lagging behind the initial plan I had in mind, I will
try my level best from now on to make up for the lost time and
complete the project in time.</p>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>As mentioned in the last post, the week before the last one I was
trying to understand event driven programming and monkeys use of epoll
to serve large number of connections and had started writing the
response part of the plugin and struggled to complete it.This week was
also spent on the same task except that I think I have a hold of what
am I doing. I have been studying the fast cgi and cgi plugins for
figuring out how to deal with writing response back to the client.</p>

<p>The CGI plugin maintains a list of connections and forks to execute
the script with a <code>execv</code> and uses two pipes to communicate with the
parent and uses epoll for getting notification when it has something
to read from the pipe and write back to the client. Similarly fast cgi
has it&rsquo;s own socket for communicating with monkey and uses epoll for
notification. In case of the lua plugin, I had a few options to
implement it. Till now, I have been executing lua code from the monkeys
thread which obviously will prevent the thread from doing anything else.
So the solution is to either fork and execute or spawn a new thread.</p>

<p>Currently, there is no particular advantage of using epoll to get
notification from the lua thread as I can only start writing to the
client socket once the entire lua script finish executing.I am stuck
on putting together this small detail and the plugin should be ready
in a bare metal state.</p>

<p>Next Week, I will sort out the remaining details for IO also taking
into acount chunked encoding and figure out a way to collect some
metrics on the execution.</p>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>This week, I was trying to get a better Idea about event driven
programming especially using epoll in specific so that I can integrate
the plugin with monkey. I found a bunch of great resources for
understanding epoll as well as other strategies and system calls
available in various operating systems to achieve concurrency.</p>

<p><a href="http://kovyrin.net/2006/04/13/epoll-asynchronous-network-programming/">http://kovyrin.net/2006/04/13/epoll-asynchronous-network-programming/</a></p>

<p>I started working on sending the response back to the client by
hooking to the epoll callbacks instead of the blocking way I was using
till now to get things done till now.</p>

<p>Also, I was looking at a way to execute the lua code in a non
blocking way. The popular approach is to use a watchdog timer or
something along the lines mentioned in this thread</p>

<p>I still haven&rsquo;t figured out a working way to make everything work
together and so haven&rsquo;t pushed in my changes as I am running into some
errors.</p>

<p>I had to move to a new apartment this week and was under some time
constraints and this weeks work required a lot more reading before I
started coding so, that leaves me with no working code till now, I
will try to fix up my code and push it by tonight.</p>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>Last week, I started to  re-factor the code I had already written for
the plugin. During the course of the project, I have been reading
source code from  ngnix and apache respective lua modules to
understand good coding patterns for lua and to understand good ways
for getting things done. I am using LUA&rsquo;s lightuserdata that allows to
access C datastructures from LUA code and also wrote a bunch of
functions to help building on top of it easier. Also I have tried to
make the code more modular.</p>

<p>I was also working on adding cookie support to the lua environment,
which took more time than I had expected. You
can get a table of all the set cookies from <code>mk.cookies.get_cookies()</code>
function call and set a cookie by this syntax
<code>mk.cookie.set_cookie{name=[name], value=[value], secure=true,
expires= os.time()+ 60*60*12}</code></p>

<h4>Next Week:</h4>

<ul>
<li>Make the response in a non blocking way</li>
<li>Start work on the duda plugin</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>This week I have been working on finishing up the request parsing
functionality for the plugin. The plugin can now handle
<code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code> as well as <code>multipart/form-data</code>
encoded form data and thus should be able to handle file uploads as
well although I haven&rsquo;t wired up the file-uploading part of the api yet.</p>

<p>I also implemented a configuration option for turning debugging on
or off which will decide whether a trace back of error will be send
back as response. To easily test all these, I went ahead and made a
blocking version for sending back the response. Everything seems to be
working fine.</p>

<h3>Next:</h3>

<ul>
<li>There is no cookie handling in the api yet although headers are
  accessible, this has to be implemented.</li>
<li>re-factor the code and remove errors that may have been introduced</li>
<li>make the plugin work in a non-blocking way.</li>
<li>decide upon how the duda package for the plugin should function</li>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>This week I had been working on the completing the environment
preparation for lua script execution. All basic tables <code>request</code>,
<code>response</code> and <code>config</code> have been implemented as of now. I had been
working on implementing some features that would make using the lua
scripting support easier like better query string and post data
parsing and also to provide a stack trace for easier error detection.I
have updated the example script from last time to show, how the new
features work.</p>

<p>A few things tripped me up like monkeys lack of query string parsing
and the fact that the query strings were not escaped caused some
problems which have been taken care of.</p>

<p>Next thing on my list is to write back the actual response from the
plugin and before that I have to check the code with valgrind.</p>
