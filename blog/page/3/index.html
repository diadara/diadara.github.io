  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>I had been away for most of the week as I had to attend a few
functions .I managed to get some work done
nevertheless. I had to rewrite the jinja template for the webfonts
module from scratch and it took more time than expected as I ran into
a few problems as I was not very familiar with the plugins to be used
and documentation wasn&rsquo;t very clear either. The templates ui is still
a little bit messy.</p>

<p>I am still having problems with font-face syntax as fonts are not
getting loaded in chromium and although firefox downloads the fonts,
the glyphs are not displayed properly. Lack of errors also makes the
bug difficult to fix. My current hypothesis is that the issue has
something to do with the mimetypes. It&rsquo;s available on
<a href="https://github.com/diadara/silpa-webfonts">github</a>.</p>

<p>This week has been a struggle for me mainly due to the lack of error
messages. I have been trying to get my version of silpa hosted on
openshift without any luck. So it seems like I to read more documentation..</p>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>This week I completed the porting of <em>Katapayadi Numbers</em>. So all the modules
except for dhwani TTS and webfonts modules have been ported. I tried a hand at
porting dhwani, which is written in C with C++ apis. The python module was using
CDLL and ctypes to directly use the c binaries. I tried to compile dhwani
from source only to get a zlib headers missing error. <em>zlib</em> was already
installed in my system and I also checked for zlib.h in /usr/includes. It looks like
some tinkering around will be required for getting this to compile. So I
decided to try later with a binary and moved on to the webfonts.</p>

<p>Silpa has a webfonts module which provide webfonts for Indian languages
which could be easily added to any site by simply linking a url. Since
we have moved to flask most of the code had to be rewritten to get this
module working. Now multiple fonts can be linked with a single url. I got
the dynamic css part working but for some reason the fonts simply are not
loading. The webfont module is using @font-face feature to include the fonts
and <a href="http://paulirish.com/2009/bulletproof-font-face-implementation-syntax/">this</a>
is good article by Paul Irish on getting it to work across all browsers.
I will try to host the site on openshift and try again to make sure the
issue is not due to any problem with serving them from localhost.</p>

<p>Also the webfonts module is written in two parts a normal python module
which will fit into silpa and the webfonts serving api as a blueprint which
allows me to simply attach it to flasks app object either at a urlprefix
or a subdomain in a single line of code which is realy usefull. Flask is
extremely flexible and you can organize your app as you please.</p>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>I ran into some problems with virtualenvs last week and it took a quite
a bit of time identifying and fixing the issue. I use
<a href="https://github.com/Lokaltog/powerline">powerline</a> with tmux, vim and zsh and
it&rsquo;s realy useful as I work mostly from a terminal and my window manager
doesn&rsquo;t provide a taskbar. Powerline requires $PYTHONPATH to be set explicitly
and archlinux comes with python3 as default, this can lead to problem&rsquo;s with
python2 apps. This was a non issue in the beginning as I work inside a
virtualenv. However I was working with a module which required cairo and
pycairo doesen&rsquo;t play well with virtualenvs and it was trying to use systems
pycairo module. This resulted in my systems python3 sitepackages path getting
included in python path of the virtualenvs. Apart from this I also managed to
do some permanant damage to my virtualenvs by force installing some packages.
After finally figuring out what&rsquo;s wrong I ended up setting python path in the
individual programs confs,  nuked .virtualenvwrapper directory and went for a
clean install.</p>

<p>So here is the porting tasks current status,</p>

<ul>
<li>TODO dhwani</li>
<li>TODO webfonts</li>
<li>TODO katapayadi numbers</li>
<li>DONE fortune</li>
<li>DONE text similarity</li>
<li>DONE stemmer</li>
<li>DONE shingling</li>
<li>DONE sort</li>
<li>DONE complex script rendere</li>
<li>DONE approxsearch</li>
<li>DONE dictionary</li>
<li>DONE guesslang</li>
<li>DONE payyans</li>
<li>DONE spellcheck</li>
<li>DONE transliterate</li>
<li>DONE hyphenate</li>
<li>DONE syllabalize</li>
<li>DONE ngram</li>
<li>DONE soundex</li>
<li>DONE chardetails</li>
</ul>


<p>I have got the basic python packages and templates for the above modules, I
still have to write unit tests, write proper documentation and go through the
templates once again so that everything is consistent.Also I have to decide
on names so that these can be released on pypi.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>Coding period started on 17th and today is 25th and that calls for an update.
I have discussed with my Mentor to reorganize the work differently from my
proposal. Earlier I was planning to write the tests together with the
modules (TDD). I thought it would be better if I do most of the testing and
documentation to the last month of the programme as I want to spend moretime
on porting tasks.</p>

<h2>So progress till now:</h2>

<h3>Separation of templates</h3>

<p>I used jinja2&rsquo;s choice loader and package loader methods to look for
templates in the templates folder of each of the individual packages and
load them if there is no corresponding template in the templates folder of the
main app. There is very good <a href="http://reliablybroken.com/b/2012/05/custom-template-folders-with-flask/">blog post</a>
about how to do this. And flask is one of most well documented projects around
and people at #pocoo were very helpful and I got  this implemented without
much trouble.</p>

<h4>Packaging</h4>

<p>This has been a very informative task for me as I got to read a lot of
kntresting stuff like <a href="http://www.clemesha.org/blog/modern-python-hacker-tools-virtualenv-fabric-pip/">this</a>
and <a href="http://www.b-list.org/weblog/2008/dec/14/packaging/">this</a>. It seems
python community is still confused about what to use for packaging as the
options are plentiful. Distribute, distutils, setuptools and a lot of forking
and merging. Silpa has been using setuptools with the neat setuptools-git
extension which packages all the git tracked files into your package.</p>

<h4>Fixing broken packages and PEP8</h4>

<p>I also fixing some of the broken packages and doing some code cleaning to make
them PEP8 compaliant.</p>

<h3>New packages</h3>

<p>I have ported syllabalizer and ngrams packages from silpa into their individual
packages. You can find them here: <a href="https://github.com/diadara/syllabalizer">syllabalizer</a> ,
<a href="https://github.com/diadara/n-gram">ngrams</a> (templates included).</p>

<h3>What&rsquo;s next ?</h3>

<ul>
<li>port remaining modules starting with guesslanguage</li>
<li>fix broken hyphenation module</li>
</ul>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>So I have been using virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper for managing python
packages.If you are moving around in your directory tree it realy gets annoying
if you have to activate the virtualenv everytime you openup a new tmuz pane or a
terminal window.I have switched to zsh recently and just discovered a feature
to automate this.Just simply put this in your .zshrc.</p>

<div>
  <pre><code class='bash'>function chpwd(){
emulate  zsh
if [ -e &quot;.venv&quot; ]; then
    # Check to see if already activated to avoid redundant activating
    if [ &quot;$VIRTUAL_ENV&quot; != &quot;$VIRTUALENVWRAPPER_HOOK_DIR/`cat .venv`&quot; ]; then
        _VENV_NAME=`cat .venv`
        echo Activating virtualenv $_VENV_NAME
        workon $_VENV_NAME
    fi
fi
}</code></pre>
</div>


<p>You have to create a .venv file in your working directory with name
of the virtualenv in it  to make use of this.There are plenty of similar solutions even if you don&rsquo;t use zsh (which you should)</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>I have been meaning to pick up emacs and thought of giving it a try.
Even for a new user, emacs looks damn cool.I have heard of emacs being
a good os and a bad text editor.After a couple of weeks of and on usage
I have to agree.Running a terminal, irc client,mail reader,terminal inside
a buffer is cool.But if feel I was more productive after using vim for
a shorter period of time.</p>

<h2>Emacs doesn&rsquo;t have text objects</h2>

<p>My favourite feature in vim are text objects and they instantly justified
my effort in learning vim.Text objects together with vim-surround plugin
instantly improves your editing speed if you are working with html or xml.
Emacs doesn&rsquo;t have that by default.Installing a plugin for that
functionality wasn&rsquo;t very appealing to me.</p>

<h2>Emacsrocks</h2>

<p>I happened to watch a couple of videos at emacs rocks and
oh was I impressed! Emacs can be efficient as vim but it seems like I
need to memorize quite a bit more.I am not giving up hope, may be one day
I will get good with emacs.Living inside a text editor doesn&rsquo;t sound too
bad.</p>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p><img src="/images/soc-logo-bw2.jpg" alt="Google Summer of Code 2013" /></p>

<p>One more attempt at blogging and I will probably continue with this at least
for this summer. My proposal for this years Google Summer of Code  got through
and I will be writing code for <a href="http://smc.org.in/">Swathanthra Malayalam Computing</a> this
summer. <a href="http://smc.org.in/">SMC</a> is community of open source enthusiasts interested in
creating software for people to use in their language of choice. They maintain
font repositories and take part in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalization_and_localization">i18n</a> of popular software as well as
maintain a few projects such as <a href="http://silpa.org.in/">SILPA</a>, Dhwani TTS and also provide an
indic webfonts service. For a full list of their activities do visit their
<a href="http://smc.org.in/">site</a>.</p>

<p>My proposal was to complete the porting of <a href="http://silpa.org.in/">SILPA</a>, the language
processing package into a more modular structure using the <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">flask</a> micro
web framework written in python. Jishnu Mohan  is my alloted mentor for the
project with Vasudev Kammath (aka copyninja) and Santhosh Thotingal acting
as a secondary mentor.They are the current maintainers of the project which aims
to bring  language processing tools for indic languages.</p>

<p>The community bonding period started on 28th May
and I am supposed to read the documentation and go through the source code and interact
with the community members till the coding period kicks off at 21st of June.For
the last two weeks I have been idling on #pocoo on freenode (these guys made flask,
 jinja2 and a lot of other cool python projects) and the people there
seemed to be really cool and are helpful to n00bs.I have been looking at some
python packaging tools, unittesting frameworks and PEP recommendations for
packaging.SILPA is currently using setup tools, with the setup-tools-git
extension which adds all the git tracked files into the python package without
the need of any fiddling around in the MANIFEST.in file.I will be using pythons
built in unittest framework, unittest to write tests for this project.I had taken
<a href="http://edx.org">edX&rsquo;s</a> SaaS class last semester,(which is a very good course,
very challenging if you don&rsquo;t know ruby, like me when I took the course)
where I heard a lot about Test Driven Development and hope to
follow some good coding practices for this project.</p>

<p>I have made some prototypes for the proposed template separation and hope to hit
the road running when the coding period starts.Till then  more
code reading to get familiar  with all the modules of silpa. Since I have a little time
on my hands now, I have some spring cleaning to do(or rather summer cleaning or formatting my
archlinux system, a new .vimrc and a new playlist).I have learnt a lot as a
developper during the gsoc application period and I am sure I will learn even
more.That&rsquo;s it for now, the talk is done, next time there will be some code
to show.</p>
