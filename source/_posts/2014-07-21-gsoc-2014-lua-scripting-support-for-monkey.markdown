I have completed a bare version of the plugin and started working on
code for monitoring lua's resource usage. Last week was mostly spend
on wiring everything together from last weeks work. I have also
started reading code for integrating the plugin with duda. I haven't
figured out how to proceed on it and haven't been able to get in touch
with Jorge this week. I will discuss with him on how to proceed next
week.

Most of the work this week was mostly re-factoring my old code to fit
in with the the plugin system and reading
