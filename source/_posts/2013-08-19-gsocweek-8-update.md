Webfonts flask extension is taking longer than expected partly because
of my college work and also since I had to rewrite some parts of it
multiple times.

Present status:

* Api completed and usable with user supplied fonts
* Changed the interface from jinja2 to a http api front end
* Configurable urls and folders.

TODO:

* documentation and testing
* clean up the api
* more features to the interface
