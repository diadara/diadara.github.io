I have been meaning to pick up emacs and thought of giving it a try.
Even for a new user, emacs looks damn cool.I have heard of emacs being
a good os and a bad text editor.After a couple of weeks of and on usage
I have to agree.Running a terminal, irc client,mail reader,terminal inside
a buffer is cool.But if feel I was more productive after using vim for
a shorter period of time.


##Emacs doesn't have text objects

My favourite feature in vim are text objects and they instantly justified
my effort in learning vim.Text objects together with vim-surround plugin
instantly improves your editing speed if you are working with html or xml.
Emacs doesn't have that by default.Installing a plugin for that 
functionality wasn't very appealing to me.


##Emacsrocks

I happened to watch a couple of videos at emacs rocks and 
oh was I impressed! Emacs can be efficient as vim but it seems like I 
need to memorize quite a bit more.I am not giving up hope, may be one day
I will get good with emacs.Living inside a text editor doesn't sound too
bad.
